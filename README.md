Build a machine learning model using "decision Tree regressor" on Zameen.com's 'Property Data Pakistan' dataset from kaggle. 
Then build a Web application using Python flask server (Backend) that uses the above model to do the http requests.
Then built simple frontend using HTML,CSS and java-script.

# DATASET
After searching from various resources online, I found a dataset available provided by Zameen.com. I extracted data for Karachi city of pakistan. The selection of this dataset was purely based on the need.


# Model selection
I used different models in order to achieve the maximum accuracy 

Based on the nature of dataset, linear regression and decision tree were chosen.

X = features (area sqrt, bedrooms, baths, locations)
Y = prediction(price)


# Accuracy


The accuracy for linear regression model gave about 83.712%

The accuracy for decision tree model gave about 94.08%
